Nemoa
========

*Nemoa* is a python package for designing and building complex systems of stacked artificial neural networks. The key goal of this project is to provide an intuitive framework for designing data transformations which implement given requirements and also respect local and global restrictions of the underlying data structure. Common requirements for example are reconstruction of missing information, data classification, structural data analysis or data dimensionality reduction. For a current featurelist see the [changelog](https://github.com/fishroot/metapath/blob/master/changelog.md).
