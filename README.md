Nemoa
========

*Nemoa* is a python package for creating and analysing deep neuronal networks from gene expression data.

#### Contributing ####
The long-term goal is to split the project:

* A *central data mining und data analysis library* based on deep artificial neuronal networks,
which allows any data mining / data collecting application to: reconstruct missing information,
reduce the dimensionality of the data, reduce noise, classify data and perform explorative data analysis.
This library should be fast and clean. Parallel computing is obviously necessary.

* Userfriendly interfaces for various applications: bioConductor
*interface for analysing and visualising gene expression data, nextgen sequencing data*

If you share this vision and want to collaborate you are very welcome!
